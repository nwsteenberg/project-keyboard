# NordWingV1

My first fully DIY mechanical keyboard.

## Goals
- [x] Split. To have flexability in positions.
- [x] Nordic Layout. Will be used for software development, but since i am Danish the æøå are essential for daily use, and should not be put into a seperate layer.
- [x] Silent. Will be used at an open office so no clicky keys.
- [X] Simple. Thumb keys might be nice, but i don't want an F16 cockpit on my thumbs. 1-2 keys should be enough.
- [X] Ortholinear & Column staggered.

## Progress:
First thing is layout. How many columns and rows do i neeed? I took a normal ISO nordic layout in keyboard-layout-editor.com, then started splitting, removing, moving and adding keys till i had something i was happy with.
I ended up with something like this:

I think it is rather simple. No complicated layers. I moved the arrow keys and some of the lessor used function keys like HOME, PGUP, PGDN etc. to a second layer since i might use them, but not every day. It is ortholinear and column staggered. Nordic layout and split.
